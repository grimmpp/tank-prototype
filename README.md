# Tank Prototype v1

I got inspired by a tank project <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:972768">ProtoTank</a> and by <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3004073">FPV Prototank with Turret</a>

I reused a lot from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:972768">ProtoTank</a> and motified the parts a bit so that e.g. nuts and screw heads disappear in them. I also modified the tank tracks so that they've got more grip.

Unfortunately the tracks are a bit loose but it works. Next time I will choose a small diameter for the track parts.

As first draft I use an arduino uno and a motor driver shield from Adeept like in the project <a href="https://github.com/grimmpp/radio-controlled-arduino-devices">radio-controlled-arduino-devices</a>, especially from the vehicle <a href="https://github.com/grimmpp/radio-controlled-arduino-devices/tree/master/projects/4WD_RC_Car_AddeptDriverBoard">4WD Car based on Adeept Board</a>. I used exactly the same software because also the 4WD car has got 4 TT-Motors and works the same way.
